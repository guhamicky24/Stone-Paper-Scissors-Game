# Stone-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game played between two players. Each player chooses one of three options: rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (two fingers extended). Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The game is often used to make quick decisions or resolve disputes.
